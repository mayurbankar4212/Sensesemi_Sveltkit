      <p class="text-[18px] mb-4 text-justify text-[#1f3363] leading-relaxed">
          The concept of Sensesemi was inspired by the personal experience of seeing a close family member fight hypertension and diabetes. Having faced several complicated challenges that came with chronic disease management first-hand, we have ensured that our products are as convenient to use as they are effective.

          <li>Rural healthcare systems that are already fighting problems related to low literacy levels, low awareness levels, and lesser  accessibility to healthcare facilities</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-[18px] mb-8 text-justify text-[#1f3363] leading-relaxed">
          Open to technology, software, and hardware-based collaborations, this also becomes a highly viable option for both corporate centers, fitness brands, and Social Service Foundations to further their cause of healthcare and wellbeing.
